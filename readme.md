# Clinicians Post Type Plugin

This plugin creates a custom post type and initializes a custom taxonomy by which these posts can be queried outside of the normal WordPress posts loop.

It satisfies a specific need on the covenanthealth.com family of websites, and certain settings may not apply to the needs of the reader. To learn more about custom posts types and custom taxonomies as they apply to WordPress, follow the links below:
